# AdventureWorks_SQL

Adventure Works is a fictional company often used as sample relacional database.

In this project, there the two main challenges. First, prepare the database for an upcoming auction. Secondly to find the ideal location for two physical stores in the United States.

During the first challenge, the aim was to establish a schema that adheres to all auction regulations, ensuring smooth stock clearance operations.

The second challenge involved selecting the stores locations without factoring in the top 30 customer cities. 

Throughout the problem-solving process, adjustments to the Adventure Works database were necessary. This included modifications to database schemas, creation of new tables, and implementation of suggested procedures to address the business challenges.
